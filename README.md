# 🌊 HydroGrid – Smart Water Infrastructure Prototype

Hackathon Project by **TexhSnatxhers**  
🚀 Built for IIC hackathon 2025

## 🔎 Problem Statement
Cities today lose **30–40% of water** due to leaks, theft, and inefficient repairs.  
Pipelines often fail silently, and citizens lack transparency about **water quality** and **fair billing**.  

---

## 💡 Our Solution
**HydroGrid** is an **IoT + AI powered smart water grid** platform with two integrated web portals:

### 👤 Citizen Portal
- View **water usage**, pay bills, and track eco-reward points  
- **Report issues** (leaks, theft, low pressure, poor quality) with location tagging  
- Explore an interactive **city water grid map** with live **Water Quality Index (WQI)**  
- Gamified **eco-rewards** system to encourage participation  

### 🏢 Department Dashboard
- Real-time **pipeline monitoring** with AI-powered anomaly detection  
- Interactive **WQI overlay map** with flow & pressure metrics  
- Manage **alerts, dispatch workforce**, and resolve issues  
- Validate citizen reports and track **system health**
